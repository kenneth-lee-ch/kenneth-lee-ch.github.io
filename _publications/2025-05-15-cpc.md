excerpt: 'Recent research proposes to limit the conditioning set size for robust causal discovery. However, the existing algorithms require exhaustive testing of all CI relations with conditioning set sizes up to a certain integer $k$. This becomes problematic in practice when variables with large support are present, as it makes CI tests less reliable due to near-deterministic relationships, thereby violating the faithfulness assumption. To address this issue, we propose a causal discovery algorithm that only uses CI tests where the conditioning sets are restricted to a given set of conditioning sets including the empty set.'
